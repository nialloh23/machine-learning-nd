#Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on in September 2016.

The Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree is an online certification. It involves

Courses in supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning and
Six projects (p0-p5 in this directory).
Courses include lecture videos, quizzes and programming problems. These courses were developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.

This directory includes lecture notes (lesson_notes) and project code (p0 to p5).
