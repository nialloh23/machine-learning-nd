# MLND-Capstone
**My capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree** 

In this project, I use a number of binary classification algorithms to determine which teachers project applications should be approved on DonorsChoose.org. My final model uses a LightGBM classifier which obtained an ROC_AUC score of 0.79.  
 
Please see my final Capstone Project Report [here](https://github.com/nialloh23/machine-learning-nd/blob/master/p5-machine-learning-capstone/ML%20Capstone%20Project%20Rev03.pdf)
