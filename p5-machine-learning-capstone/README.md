# MLND-Capstone
**My capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree** 

In this project, I use a number of binary classification algorithms to determine which teachers project applications should be approved on DonorsChoose.org. My final model uses a LightGBM classifier which obtained an ROC_AUC score of 0.79.  
 
Please see my final Capstone Project Report [here](myLib/README.md)  
Also, see my original capstone proposal [here](nialloh23/machine-learning-nd/p5-machine-learning-capstone/Capstone Project Proposal_NOH Rev02.pdf)  

## Dataset
You can download the full data set used for this project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening/data)
The datasets include a train.csv, test.csv and resources.csv and samplesubmission.csv

## Software & Libraries
Python 3.5 or higher. Most of the included code also works in Python 2.7. I would suggest downloading with Anaconda as you will get some of the below:  
nltk  
numpy   
pandas  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn  
scipy  

## Key Files
The key files in my project are:  
**approving_applications_rev01.ipynb** [here](myLib/README.md) - All of my projects code is contained with this single Jupyter Notebook..
